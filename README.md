This project contains the matlab code of the point set registration algorithms described in the following paper:

Q. Liao, D. Sun, and H. Andreasson, "FuzzyPSReg: Strategies of Fuzzy Cluster-based Point Set Registration", *IEEE Transactions on Robotics*, 2021. [PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Da-Sun-4/publication/355253289_FuzzyPSReg_Strategies_of_Fuzzy_Cluster-Based_Point_Set_Registration/links/6190254f07be5f31b77b3d36/FuzzyPSReg-Strategies-of-Fuzzy-Cluster-Based-Point-Set-Registration.pdf?origin=publication_detail)


FuzzyPSReg-SS aligns two similar-sized point clouds with sufficient overlaps. 
It is extended from our previous work at https://gitsvn-nt.oru.se/qianfang.liao/FuzzyClusterBasedRegistration


FuzzyPSReg-O2S aligns two point clouds with a relatively large difference in size and can be used for object pose estimation. 
It may need users to check the results, please refer to the paper for details. 


You can run *demoi.m* in matlab to see the results.
